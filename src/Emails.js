            Just got off the phone with Kira.  She asked me what y'all do and I probably
            butchered it, but she sounded interested (especially when I closed by saying
            it
            would be a business services, fee-based revenue stream - from what I know in
            the industry, Yahoo's all about that these days, trying to find complements to
            its existing largely ad-driven model for which they are getting pummeled).
            She
            said you should forward any information on to her at kira@yahoo-inc.com.  To
            reach her by phone (I'd recommend handling initial contact through email and
            then suggesting phone time, but your call), I don't have her direct number,
            but
            called the main Yahoo corporate number 408-731-3300, then used the dial by
            name
            directory - her last name is spelled Zahn, but you have to keep adding letters
            from her first name (i went through K-I) before it will recognize it.  She and
            her husband both were in law school with me and are very, very cool folks.  He
            works at Silicon Valley Bank now.
            Let me know if there's anything else I can do to help.

            Yes, I do.  Two actually.  Drew Lanham and Kira Zann.  Rather than me
            putting
            stuff in an email about which of the two you should go through, call me
            when
            you can.  I'm at the house all day today 435-655-2939.  Tomorrow I'm at the
            office, but can be reached by cell 801-556-8490.  There's a definite
            difference
            between the two, but they both work together.

            By the way, sorry we missed you over T-day weekend - hope you had a good
            weekend in OU country, despite the close game...  Let's try to get together
            over New Year's if you'll be around.  We're in Dec. 29-Jan. 2.

            I got your name (and email address) from Chad Muir and was hoping to arrange
            a time to briefly (and informally) talk to you about Yahoo's B2B business
            strategy and whether you think there might be any opporunities to discuss
            some strategic relationship between Yahoo and Enron Net Works's DealBench
            subsidiary.
            Without getting into too many details, DealBench is an ASP addressing the
            needs of large, secure, sophisticated transaction participants.   We are
            currently offering live online auctioning capabilities, online virtual
            datarooms and certain deal areas for the syndication of bank products and
            lease portfolios.  We have completed transactions with nominal value of over
            $4 Billion since launching the site 4 months ago.   My initial thought is
            that this could potentially fit in nicely with what I believe is Yahoo's need
            for recurring transaction-based revenues in certain B2B areas.
            Hopefully we can find time to talk soon.
            Take care,

            fixes / new features.  Included in them are:
             1.  Configurable Questionnaire
             2.  Invitee Lists Part I (this does NOT include the upload of the contact
            lists)
             3.  User Statistics
             4.  Fix for the Issuing Entity
             5.  Auction security fix
             6.  Auction enhancements Part I
             7.  Rewrite of the view deal page impacting permission levels in EVERY domain
             8.  The Adapter for the User Registration piece (this should be seamless to
            the user, but be happy that     this change ELIMINATES message brokers from
            this process)
             9.  Various bug fixes including those relating to view closing etc.
            The remaining auction enhancements are planned to be pushed sometime early
            next week.
            I would recommend everybody spend some time testing next week and reflect
            their comments / suggestions to John and I.
            The location of the test site is:  http://testfinweb1.ecomtest.enron.com.
            You also need to establish new IDs and passwords (since your production IDs
            and Passwords will not work!).  The admin ID and password (if you need to
            approve users and deals to test them are - ID: jspitz; Pwd: pass).
            We do PLAN on pushing all this stuff to PRODUCTION (barring any major bugs or
            mishaps) next FRIDAY - Dec 8th, 2000.
            Look forward to your comments.  Thanks.  SR:-)

            Hope things are going well.
            In the next few days we need to do two things.
            1. Set the termination value of the existing options
            2. Set the terms for new options for the next year.
            Since the option is cash settled and not settled with actual currency
            payments, while we need actual currency exchanges to mitigate our risk, we
            would like to talk to you to manage that.
            We also need to spend a few minutes, on the structure of the next set of
            options, to ensure a good execution.
            When you get  a chance give William Stuart ( 713-853-1507) our ccy trader
            or myself (713-853-6750) a call, or point us in the right direction.

            silly
            and squeezing the asses of cocktail waitresses while losing money at

            We don't have a chimney in our house, how do you get into our home?
            Love, Marky

            Mark,
            First, stop calling yourself "Marky", that's why you're getting your
            Ass whipped at school. Second, you don't live in a house, you live in a

            Today's live auction for Northern Border Pipeline's procurement of line pipe
            was quite a success!  Here are some highlights:
            The auction lasted longer than the scheduled 15 minutes due to the automatic
            extension feature resulting from new Best Bids placed during the last two
            minutes of the auction.  Please note that we earned $52,500 for this auction
            and are on track to do another auction for NBPL on 1/30 for a $20,000 fee.

            Good Day to you.
            I would like to introduce myself and my company.
            Kalahari Ltd is a UK based software company that has for the past 14
            years been supply pricing software to the Financial Markets.
            Over the past year we have been branching out into the energy markets
            and are currently working for a number of UK based Electricity
            companies.
            One such company (London Electricity) has asked us to produce software
            to filter and highlight online trading prices. This allows them to see
            ONLY the best price in the market for any one product at a time. This is
            due to the sudden explosion of internet based price delivery systems. To
            enable us to acieve their requirements we require an API to the relative
            online trading systems. Today I spoke to a gentlemen in your call centre
            who gave me your contact details. Could you please advise me if you do
            indeed publish an API to your internet trading platform and if so how do
            I go about getting it.
            We would of course be prepared to sign a non disclosure agreement in
            this respect.
            I look forward to hearing from you in due course.

            I am sending you the EOL model on Greg Piper's request. The model reflects
            accurately the traded volumes on EOL for 2000. Projections for 2001- 2011
            were built based on feedback from traders, investment bank and research
            institutes B2B forecasts and, common sense. These can be manipulated by
            changing the assumptions in the assumption sheet.
            On the financial side the balance sheet and income statement have not been

            Good evening ...one and all . It hardly seems possible that  we are another
            week on  already such has been the pace of activity here . The  ebb and flow
            in the Ali  market both in the spreads and outright price have kept  our
            valiant dealers on their toes  as  seemingly the whole market  vies to  avail
            itself of our  pricing and liquidity services on-line ! .   Daily volumes
            have  continued to grow with  over 800  separate transactions being seen
            today! .  In fact volumes have risen by approximately  56% since December
            from a daily average  of 357 to a daily average of 557  for January .At the
            same time the regular Non-EOL transaction count has decreased from about 1800
            trades a day to 1586 trades  since December.    Your efforts at getting  the
            registered customers who had not  completed an on line trade are beginning
            to  pay dividends  finally - but the migration remains painfully slow . Keep
            plugging away



             The graph  above illustrates the growth of our  average daily online
            transaction volumes  in relation to our regular transaction volume on a
            monthly basis  from July of 99 to date .
            This week's daily  transaction volume  is another  record and   but for the
            blip on Monday  which put down to the  Mother's day in Africa  holiday  would
            have been sensational .



            We have asked for your response to several queries over the past three weeks
            and have received little or no  reaction.  Consequently we shall ask again.
            Currently at the top of the list:  if  each of you could create a list of
            Metals Conferences you believe would be beneficial for Enron metals to
            attend, speak at and/ or have metals or EnronOnline presence, it would be
            greatly appreciated. This is a multi faceted sales and marketing tool for
            your benefit  .  Aside from the overall goal of creating a unified metals
            marketing plan, we are also trying to prepare a budget to assure that proper
            attention and funds are given Enron metals Global exposure in 2001 .
            Therefore, if we do not receive your recommendations  well in  advance we
            will not be in a position to sponsor them . We have created a conference
            listing which will be circulated next week . Please add to it  if we have
            missed any off . and mark onto our list those you think should have  our
            attention .
            For those of you that missed it last week, we have attached another copy of
            the Account Application Form.  The completion of this form for BOTH
            traditional and online customers will speed your client's access to trading
            with Enron Metals.
            The lack of contributions for this review  from  any of you is  rather
            disappointing . We will continue to offer you  items that you may find of use
            . However the purpose of this  review is also  to incorporate content  from
            around the network of our  global field offices.    I know you are all very
            busy  making money for the cause . This  medium is  a useful platform to get
            your message over .
            For those of you not on the circulation lists  see the attached reports
                   The Metals Crammer report
                   The daily Options report
             Whilst not exactly a feature  we thought it might be  a useful exercise in
            client relationship damage  limitation  to explain   what happens when a
            customer finds he cannot trade  on line .This has begun to occur more
            regularly as our volumes and activity increase.
             Customers are allocated  a credit line for EOL within the system based upon
            their  agreements.  This limit   is set daily   as a  default against the
            clients name . basis the AS400 's  net valuation of the client's position  .
            The amount of available  variation  credit  on the client's account  on EOL
            is  set as his  limit f or the next days trading . If the client should
            trigger this limit  during the next day's trading  the system will reject the
            trade and lock out the customer . Not very user friendly   as the customer is
            not told why .  London credit (Hamish's team) get a red flag , as of course
            do the traders running the stack managers as they see the trade rejected.
            The problem now becomes one of frustration for the customer as the system
            will not allow him to liquidate his position either in part or whole .He will
            have to pick the phone to do this . Secondly the resetting of any limit in
            the system takes 48hrs .  This  is being  worked on but  we must remember
            that Metals are the only futures products on the system and the other OTC
            products on the system  are dealt with differently .  It also serves to
            highlight that  clients with small credit lines in the 1 to 200,000 dollar
            range are not really suited to use EOL . Security  such as g/tees and cash
            are taken into account but can be missed  ,but forward profits are as it is
            net availability that is  used on the AS400.   This will all improve with the
            introduction of  a new bridge  between the Enron  risk system and the AS400
            in the very near future .

             In the meantime  it will be up to you to  keep the peace and explain to your
            clients .  Get them to keep within their limits . Call them quickly when they
            get locked out.
            Remember, we are here to help your efforts and help create positive
            communication lines between our offices world-wide.  So, send us your
            thoughts, questions, concerns, local area market news  etc.  We will look

            Hope things are going well.
            In the next few days we need to do two things.
            1. Set the termination value of the existing options
            2. Set the terms for new options for the next year.
            Since the option is cash settled and not settled with actual currency
            payments, while we need actual currency exchanges to mitigate our risk, we
            would like to talk to you to manage that.
            We also need to spend a few minutes, on the structure of the next set of
            options, to ensure a good execution.
            When you get  a chance give William Stuart ( 713-853-1507) our ccy trader
            or myself (713-853-6750) a call, or point us in the right direction.

            Dear Chuck,
            Nice spelling. You're on your way to a career in lawn care. How about I
            send you an elementary reading book so you can learn to read and write?
            I'm giving your older brother the space ranger. At least HE can spell!
            Santa


            Dear Santa,
            I have been a good girl all year, and the only thing I ask for is peace
            And joy in the world for everybody!
            Love,Sarah

            Dear Sarah,
            Your parents smoked pot when they had you, didn't they?
            Santa


            Dear Santa,
            I don't know if you can do this, but for Christmas, I'd like for my mommy
            and daddy to get back together. Please see what you can do.
            Love,Teddy

            Dear Teddy,
            Look, your dad's banging the babysitter like a screen door in a
            hurricane. Do you think he's gonna give that up to come back to your
            frigid mom,
            Who rides his butt constantly? It's time to give up that dream. Let me get
            you some nice Legos instead.
            Santa


            Dear Santa,
            I want a new bike, a Playstation, a train, some G.I. Joes, a dog, a Drum
            kit, a pony and a tuba.
            Love, Francis

            Dear Francis,
            Who names their kid "Francis" nowadays? I bet you're gay.
            Santa


            Dear Santa,
            I left milk and cookies for you under the tree, and I left carrots for
            your
            reindeer outside the back door.
            Love, Susan

            Dear Susan,
            Milk gives me the runs and carrots make the deer fart in my face when
            riding in the sleigh. You want to do me a favor? Leave me a bottle of
            scotch.
            Santa


            Dear Santa,
            What do you do the other 364 days of the year? Are you busy making toys?
            Your friend, Thomas

            Dear Thomas,
            All the toys are made in China. I have a condo in Vegas, where I spend
            most
            of my time making low-budget porno films. I unwind by drinking myself
            silly
            and squeezing the asses of cocktail waitresses while losing money at
            the craps table.
            Hey, you wanted to know.
            Santa

            Dear Santa,
            Do you see us when we're sleeping, do you really know when we're
            awake, like in the song?
            Love, Jessica

            Dear Jessica,
            Are you really that gullible?
            Good luck in whatever you do. I'm skipping your house.
            Santa

            Dear Santa,
            I really really want a puppy this year. Please please please PLEASE
            PLEASE could I have one?
            Timmy

            Timmy,
            That whiney begging shit may work with your folks, but that crap
            doesn't work with me. You're getting a sweater again.
            Santa

            Dearest Santa,
            We don't have a chimney in our house, how do you get into our home?
            Love, Marky

            Mark,
            First, stop calling yourself "Marky", that's why you're getting your
            Ass whipped at school. Second, you don't live in a house, you live in a
            low-rent apartment complex. Third, I get inside your pad just like all
            the burglars do, through your bedroom window.
            Sweet Dreams,

            I am sending you the EOL model on Greg Piper's request. The model reflects

            were built based on feedback from traders, investment bank and research
            institutes B2B forecasts and, common sense. These can be manipulated by
            changing the assumptions in the assumption sheet.
            On the financial side the balance sheet and income statement have not been

            Over the past year we have been branching out into the energy markets
            and are currently working for a number of UK based Electricity
            companies.
            One such company (London Electricity) has asked us to produce software
            to filter and highlight online trading prices. This allows them to see
            ONLY the best price in the market for any one product at a time. This is
            due to the sudden explosion of internet based price delivery systems. To
            enable us to acieve their requirements we require an API to the relative
            online trading systems. Today I spoke to a gentlemen in your call centre
            who gave me your contact details. Could you please advise me if you do
            indeed publish an API to your internet trading platform and if so how do
            I go about getting it.
            We would of course be prepared to sign a non disclosure agreement in
            this respect.
            I look forward to hearing from you in due course.

            I wanted to thank you for taking the time to interview me this past
            Wednesday.  I enjoyed meeting you and other representatives of the company
            and left our interview with a much greater understanding of what drives
            Enron and what the company seeks in its applicants.  Your responses to my
            questions only confirmed my already high opinion of the company.
            As you know, I am a first year student at Owen concentrating in Finance and
            Electronic Commerce.  I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Bentley College in
            May of 1997 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics & Finance, and I
            received an Honors Certificate in Economics from the University of Cambridge
            in August of 1995.
            After graduating from Bentley, I worked for Digital Equipment Corporation as
            an analyst in its Financial Development Program.  Most recently, I worked as
            an investments analyst for Thomson Financial, where I evaluated three major
            business development initiatives and five acquisition proposals totaling $44
            million and worked with senior management on a takeover bid for one of
            Thomson's key competitors.  I also performed strategic, market, and
            competitor analysis, and proposed ways of improving the organization's
            overall competitiveness.  My professional experiences working in the High
            Technology and Financial Information Services industries have led to a
            complete redefinition of my career goals.  I much prefer to be on the front
            lines of business, helping some of the world's most established
            organizations make decisions that will impact their financial future and
            competitive position in the market.   I am anxious to begin my career with
            Enron and believe that a relationship with company would prove mutually
            beneficial.
            In closing, I would like to thank you again for interviewing me in
            Nashville.  If you have any questions, please contact via e-mail at
            Ajay.Jagsi@owen2002.vanderbilt.edu or at (615) 673-0329.
            Have a wonderful week!

      text: ` Here is my summary of our second round summer interviews.  Top 3 candidates
            below.
            1. Craig -  Well rounded, Military background, excellent leadership
            experience (aircraft carrier pilot), did not have a finance background, but
            performed very well on Harry's analytical interview.  Very personable,
            confident and sold himself well.  I think he is very interested in Enron and
            would likely accept.
            2. Victor - He was a strong candidate in my more subjective interview, but I
            didn't think he was quite as strong as Ajay.  However he outperformed Ajay in
            the analytical interview.  With that feedback from Harry I feel comfortable
            placing Victor ahead of Ajay.  Also very interested in Enron.
            3. Ajay -  Very polished, presented/sold himself very well, Excellent
            understanding of Enron's business (did his homework),  Relative to others
            based on my interview he ranked in the top 2, However did not perform as well
            as others in the top 4-5 in the analytical interview.  For this reason I'd
            push him back to number three.
            Aside from these three there were two others that are worth discussing.
            Casey Jones
            Andrew Rosenberg
            We Understand these two may have outstanding offers from firms that they are
            very interested in.  I would not consider either of these two ahead of Craig,
            but might place Casey ahead of Victor.  However I think Casey is least likely
            to accept the offer.  My suggestion would be to make offers to Craig &
            Victor, then consider a 3rd offer to Andrew, recognizing we would likely get
            a maximum of 2/3.
